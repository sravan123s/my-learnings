CREATING A MASTER AND SLAVE CONFIGURATION IN JENKINS?

A Jenkins master comes with the basic installation of Jenkins, and in this configuration, 
the master handles all the tasks for your build system.
If you are working on multiple projects you may run multiple jobs on each and every project. 
Some projects need to run on some particular nodes, and in this process, we need to configure 
slaves. Jenkins slaves connect to the Jenkins master using the Java Network Launch Protocol.
The Jenkins master acts to schedule the jobs and assign slaves and send builds to slaves to 
execute the jobs.
It will also monitor the slave state (offline or online) and getting back the build result 
responses from slaves and the display build results on the console output. The workload of 
building jobs is delegated to multiple Slaves.

WHY DO YOU NEED A CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION OF DEVELOPMENT & TESTING?

WHAT IS MEANT BY CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION?
1.Developers check out code into their private workspaces.
2.When they are done with it they commit the changes to the shared repository (Version Control Repository).
3.The CI server monitors the repository and checks out changes when they occur.
4.The CI server then pulls these changes and builds the system and also runs unit and integration tests.
5.The CI server will now inform the team of the successful build.
6.If the build or tests fails, the CI server will alert the team.
7.The team will try to fix the issue at the earliest opportunity.
8.This process keeps on repeating.

HOW YOU ARE MANAGING THE HIGH AVAILABILITY IN JENKINS OR HAVE U CONFIGURED THE REPLICATION FOR JENKINS?

   and standby master, 
   when customer hits my jenkins.com to my LB

HOW YOU ARE MANAGING JENKINS SHARED LIRARIES?
 A shared library is a collection of independent Groovy scripts which you pull into your Jenkinsfile at runtime.
The best part is, the Library can be stored, like everything else, in a Git repository. This means you can version, tag, and do all the cool stuff you’re used to with Git.
 To use the shared library in a pipeline, you add @Library('your-library-name') to the top of your pipeline definition, or Jenkinsfile.
 
 (or)
 
Jenkins shared library is having common pipeline code in version contro; system and that can be used by anu no of pipelines just by refering it, infact multiple teams can use the same 
library for their pipeline

TYPES OF JENKINS PIPELINE
DECLARATIVE: Declarative pipeline has stages for every individual stage there are multipul steps in it
SCRIPTED: Scripted pipelinecode is a traditional way of working, In scripted there is no need of steps,

 To deploy artifacts to envernments we have to install publish over ssh plugin first

SOME OF THE JENKINS PLUGINS
Maven integration==> It will give maven project
pipeneline utility steps==> used for the pipeline code
docker pipeline
role based authentication plugin==> to give roles to the users

WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES FASED WHILE CREATING PIPELINES?
1. memory sortage 
2. Ownership-Based CI/CD Challenges
3. path issues
4. ssh communication not working
6. Cost & Resource Management
7. plugin issues
8. un able to find crediantial ids
9. typo errors
10. not giving premissions properly
