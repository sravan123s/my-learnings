WHAT ARE ON DEAMAND, SPOT, RESERVED, DEDICATED INSTANCES?
ONDEAMAND:if we want instances at the time of our need we want to pay more money bcs we dint plan any thing before
SPOT:It is like bidding instances on hourly bases, for ex if u bid a serevr at $5 if another person will bid more 
     than that $5 that server will go to that person so better not to keep any valuable data in spot instances
RESERVED:To decrease the cost of instances we will reserve them earlier
DEDICATED:In AWS data centers there are many racks in normal if we lanch aws instance it will go to any one of 
          the racks but in dedicated aws will give one dediacted rack to us now all the instance we lanch will go to that rack ;p/
