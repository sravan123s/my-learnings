a. no

17. To pass any arguments in CL we will use "-e" 
18. In ansible conditions==> when,loops==>items
19. Ignore-errors
a.  To skip from non executable task
20. In ansible we can use "-l" to execute the programme in a perticular server out of no of servers
     ex. ansible playbook -l server1 (or) "-i" creat a file and place the server names in it (inventory file)
21. Structure of a role. default things you will get while creating role
22. Say any 10 modules in ansible/terraform,pyton
a.  Handlers,tasks,url,file,service,template
23. Diff b/w Git and Git Hub
24. conflits
25. How to configure auto trigger from git to jenkins
26. How to change port no 8080->80
a. Go to conf folder in tomcat installation directory e.g. C:\Tomcat 6.0\conf\
   Edit following tag in server.xml file <Connector connectionTimeout="20000" port="8080" 
   protocol="HTTP/1.1" redirectPort="8443"/>
   Change the port=8080 value to port=80.
   Save file.
   Stop your Tomcat and restart it
27. CMD and ENTRYPOINT
28. ADD and COPY
29. Any optimisations done on deocker
a. Don't install unnecessary packages. ...
   Implement . ...
   Sort multi-line arguments. ...
   Decouple applications. ...
   Minimize the number of layers. ...
   Leverage build cache.
30. Multi statge docker builds
31. Can we have even no.of masters
a. No bcs to avoid split brain issue we have to opt for odd no.of masters in kubernetes
32. What are master components and worker components
33. In kubernetes how your cluster look like 
34. Non prod cluster			prod cluster
     dev,sit,uat,pt			pre-prod,prod
35.In kubernetes deployment stratagy
 a.rolling update: in this if we make any changes to deployment configuration it will affect the pod one by one it means it will kill one pod and generate another one by one
   recreate:in this if we make any changes to deployment configuration it will affect all pods at a time it means it will kill all pods at once and create all pods at a time 
   custom:
36. persistant and non-persistant data
a. permanent(pv $ pvc) and non permanent

37. Statefull vs stateless pods
a. If any pods depends on volumes those are called state full pods,any pods which are independs on volumes those are called state less pods


38. what is symbolic link and hard link
39. How do u install a package
40. Difference b/w file system and a folder
41.  how many types we can creat a file system
a. LVM and standered partiation
42. How do you verify whether the application running or not
a. we login to the server and we will verify the app status using "ps -ef|grep -i app name" if iam not getting any data 
   i will verify whether the application is running on a perticular port or not "netstat -nap|grep portno" ,if the applicaton
   not running on that port i will try to start the app "systemctl start app name" , still there is some issue i will verify 
   logs using "tail -f /var/log/app.log" once i figured out the issue i will inform to application developer.
43. How do you find out appliation performance
a. Historical information like cpu and memory if this guy required some memory ill start looking out for a server with 
   optimised memory that is taking instances like c5 medium and m4
44. How do you verify port status, how do u configure file systems
a. netstat -nap|grep portno for ports status, 
45. serever is not reachable how do you troublehoot
a. firts i will ping ip if the server is not reachable i will try to do a ssh ip address if it is not reachable i will loged into the 
   console the first command i will give is "ifconfig -a" check ether0 if it is down give systemctl resart the network once we restart 
   we will try to ssh now the server is up and running still iam not able to access the server now i will check SG whether my ip is 
   allowed or not and i will verify when iam hitting my vpc that is my IGW i will verify my route table, NACL, subnet ,EC2 and SG
   most of the cases if the server is not reachable reason is my SG still if it is not reachable under my NACL i might blocked my ip address
46. Recent automation done using shell scripting
a. monitoring- i wrote a script like to do custom health checks so what my script will do it will exicute for evary 5 min if it ok it 
   will send ok msg else it will send email to my mail address
47. what is $? , $# , $1,$2,$3 , $0
48. wite infinite loop
a. while true
   do 
      echo "HI"
   done

49. how do you know the previous commands exicuted or not
a. if[[$? == 0]]
     then 
   
   fi
50. why shebang (#!) symbol used?
    It is used to define where the code should be executed 
50. In shell scripting there is no need of indendation
50. want 10 modules of python
a. sys,boto3,os,sub-process,password,smtp,json,yaml
51. in teraform they might ask for scenario which is give one ec2 bounded to vpc with its own key-pair and SG, then will send a 
    app code (java or nodjs) and write as a IAC or pac and push that code to the github and share the gitrepo link
52. how are you mannaging the tfstate file
a.  there are two ways 1. GIT 2. S3 with dynamodb
53. iam running my ec2 instance it is not a part of my terraform code is there any posibility to make it as terraform code
a. yes, import command helps to convert infrastructure to code
54. infra provisionig and infra controlling
55. hostes file management , dynameic host management
a. by giving tags to my ec2 instances
56. 10 modules which you are using in ansible 
a. command,script, get url, debug,regester,set-fact,copy,handler,
57. iam running my code thete is one task failed i want to skip my task how?
a. ignore_errors
58. i have a task that i want to run in a perticular server or a other servers we will use
a. delegate to
59. if the task should execute locally from where you are executing
a. local_action
60. i executed a code and the code failed on 5 serevrs, now i want exicute code on failed servers
a. ansible-playbook -i list of failed servers
61. chef vs ansible

63. how you are managing the high availability in jenkins or have u configured the replication for jenkins?
a. no replication there will be only one master, we have our /var/lib/jenkins from out NFS or EFS, under my LB i have my master 
   and standby master, 
   when customer hits my jenkins.com to my LB 
64. how you are managing jenkins builds
a. shared library- we have a shared library once we write a code in shared library it get shared 
65. in dockers how do you build, run,push , what is repository,container, how do we work with containers, how do u optimise the 
    build size or image size , multistage builds
66. in kubernetes my deployment not working what will we do?
a. kubectl get deploy==>kubectl get pods -l deploy selector name==> kubectl logs -f pod name it will give me info (or) kubectl  
   describe pod pod name
67.What kind of error msgs you will observe?
a. configmap errors , iamge pull errors, pv bound issues, out of memory (OOM)
68. What is Schuduling,node selector,labels,selectors, diff b/w deployment and demon set , replicaset , how do u patch , how 
    do u add and remove node cluster, status not ready ,schudule disabale
a. labels: Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods. Labels are  used to identifying attributes of 
   objects that are meaningful and relevant to users, but do not directly imply semantics to the core system.
   Selector: Here is you can see selector tag, which is used by deployment to talk with its pods here Deployment finds which Pods 
   to manage. In this case, you simply select a label that is defined in the Pod template
   Node selector:A node selector specifies a map of key/value pairs that are defined using custom labels on nodes and selectors 
   specified in pods. For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the same key/value node selector as the label on the node.
   Replicaset: A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods
69. What is static pod (or) i want to run a pod without master is it possible
a.  yes, we can do it we have to put pod.yaml file in the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/ that's it kubelet will Give the pod 
    " pod name followed by serever name"
70. Access modes you have PV and PVC
71. PROB-
72. paching and cluster management
73. In 4 pod 3 only responding why--> Hung
74. diff b/w schedule disabled and drain
75. have you ever done patching , what are the steps to do patching
a.  svr backup, etcd backup, pick 1/2 works and 1 master, drain the node, we do patching, set shedule disable to false(un cordon)
76. Ingress
77. what have you done in your project w.r.t monitoing?

78. how do u trouble shoot application issues?
a. first i need to go to application server and check logs if the logs are noy gettting or not understanding then we will curl with ip and port,
   even though it is not working means i will hit in the browser if all the things what we are doing is not working then inform to the application guy

git hub api
build life cycle of maven==> clean build and site
how can u copy data from one serever to another serever in jenkins
what is the diff b/w sonar gate and quality profile
diff b/w containerazion and virtualilazation==> memoty utilazation if u rae wasting 4 gb if data we cant take it back
ingress in kubernetes
about docker volumes
helm,exit status
handlers==> if something notifies handlers will do work
docker compose
use of command &&==> for process id
&?==> previous command execution status
trap command

to find the file existance in shell we can find through executing code.
if we want to check the version of any package we can use case statement

AWS --region us-east-1 sns publish --topic arn "arn name" --message "testing mail service"==> to send email notificatio n
crontab==> to schedule a event like copping moving in a specified time, we use crontab(ex: we need to mv some log files daily 4am)

What are you doing with shell scripting daily?
check the shell scripting student notes there will be some shell scripting use cases

==> In ansible we will use -l in cli for limiting the servers for execution 

==> In Docker Networking after creating the docker server by installing docker software there will be a default docker0 port 
    it will manage the ip address of the containers, if we want we can create custom network the command is docker network create 
    we can create then after all the ips of the containers you create is from custom network range 
    there are 3 types of networking
    1. Bridge networks==> It is used with the single host
    2. overlay networks==> It is used to conmmunicate between multi hosts
    3. macvlan networks==> IS is used to connect docker containers directly to the host network interfaces
