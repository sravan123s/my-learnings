What is TCP and UDP?
TCP is a connection-oriented communication protocol. UDP is a connectionless communication protocol. TCP data units are known as packets. ... 
UDP is designed for faster data transmission. TCP guarantees data delivery by prioritizing data integrity, completeness, and reliability

On most Linux operating systems, the DNS servers that the system uses for name resolution are defined in the /etc/resolv. 
 conf file. That file should contain at least one nameserver line. Each nameserver line defines a DNS server.

WHAT IS INODE
Linux Inodes
An Inode number is a uniquely existing number for all the files in Linux and all Unix type systems.
When a file is created on a system, a file name and Inode number is assigned to it.
Generally, to access a file, a user uses the file name but internally file name is first mapped with respective Inode number stored in a table.

POSITION PARAMETER?
positional Parameters are used to pass the information to the shell directly with command line argument or indirectly using set and command substitution. 
It can be assigned from shell argument and it is denoted by $N, where N is the single digit and referred as parameter N.

WHAT IS SYMBOLIC LINK OR SOFT LINK?
 Symobolic link act similarly to  shotcuts in windows, Such links points to program files and directories,
 It also allowes u to access to it without having to go directly to entire pathname, But if we delete original file there is no use of shortcut file
 to create soft link we will use "ln -s"  <file name>
 
 WHAT ARE HAURD LINKS?
 Hard links points directly to the physical  file or disk, and not on the path name. This means that if u 
 try to rename or  move the original file the link well not break since the link is for the file itself, not the path where the file is located
 to create hard link we will use "ln" <file name>
 
WHAT ARE RUN LEVELS?
There are seven different runlevels in Linux, from zero to six. different distributions may use the seven runlevels differently, 
we need to check how the runlevels work on the specific distribution that we are using. 
Runlevel 0 shuts down the system.
Runlevel 1 is a single-user mode, which is used for maintenance or administrative tasks, or we can say as root user 
Runlevel 2 is a multi-user mode. This runlevel does not use any networking services.
Runlevel 3 is a multi-user mode with networking. This is the normal runlevel you are used to if you use a system that doesn’t boot into a GUI (graphical user interface).
Runlevel 4 is not used. The user can customize this runlevel for their own purposes 
Runlevel 5 is the same as runlevel 3, but it also starts a display manager. This is the runlevel you are using if you use a system that boots into a GUI.
Runlevel 6 reboots the system. 

TOP COMMAND
PID: Shows task’s unique process id.
PR: Stands for priority of the task. It is always (20+NI)
SHR: Represents the amount of shared memory used by a task.
VIRT: Total virtual memory used by the task.
USER: User name of owner of task.
%CPU: Represents the CPU usage.
TIME+: CPU Time, the same as ‘TIME’, but reflecting more granularity through hundredths of a second.
NI: Represents a Nice Value of task. A Negative nice value implies higher priority, and positive Nice value means lower priority. 
    If Ni is negative the cpu time is zero, the %CPU time spent idle
%MEM: Shows the Memory usage of task.

HOW TO CHANGE PROCESS PRIORITY USING LINUX NICE AND RENICE ?
You can change the process priority using nice and renice commands, Nice command will launch a process with an user defined scheduling priority. 
Renice command will modify the scheduling priority of a running process.
The process scheduling priority range is from -20 to 19. We call this as nice value.
A nice value of -20 represents highest priority, and a nice value of 19 represent least priority for a process.

for load average we will use "uptime" commamd

VIRTUAL MEMORY?
It is the memory management technique wich there will be mapping data to shared disks

umask==>the umask values is controlling the default permissions we can change the umask value. 
For example we have umask value 002 by default the file permissions are 666 so 666-002=644 this the default permission will get.

The default file permission value is 0644, and the default directory’s is 0755

CHECK THE CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO SERVERS?
1. TELNET: telnet <dest ip> <port>
2. NCAT OR NC: nc -vz <host name> ,port>
3. WGET: wgey <URL>
4. CURL: curl -v telnet://<IP>:<port>
5. NMAP: nmap -p <port> <IP>
6. PING: ping <IP>
7.ifconfig

usercan login to the server without the keys to do so what we have to do is after creating user we give pasword to that user through passwd command 
after that go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config there we need to change password authentication to yes by default it is set to no

LINUX DEFAULT DIRECTORIES
                       PARENT
     ____________________/__________________________
	|       |        |        |       |      |      |
   TMP     USR      HOME     VAR     ETC    ROOT   OPT
TMP: It is for temporary purposes
URS: what ever the commands we are executing in the linux os will be goint to this users directory
HOME: What are the user we are creating in the linux every user identity is in the user home directory
VAR: In this logs will be stored from the system starting time to now
ETC: All the software configuration will present in etc
ROOT: All the users in the linux has the HOME as their home directory but root users home directory is root
OPT: Optional we can use or not no problem

FILESYSTEM MANAGEMENT(if any doubts check the linux first video) 
   File system--> any directory which is mount to the disk that directory we call as file system 
   Working with Filesystem-->Standard partition,Logical Volume Management
   Standard partition--> drawback is We cannot increase the filesystem size dynamically in standard 
   |                      partition  it requires downtime.
   |__> 1.primary, 2.extended, 3.logical
    
   Logical Volume Management==> physical volumes-->volume group--> logical volume--> data or mountpoint
