STEPS TO CONFIGURE GRAFANA
 From Prometheus.io we need to download exporter, install node exporter on linux box, 
 now lets create two server one for prometheus and other for grafana, install prometheus in 
 prometheus server, then we need to update prometheus.yml file keep node exporter server IP 
 and port in that, In promitius lets check in targets we will find both node exporter and promitius servers, 
 Now install grafana in grafana server after installation we need to add data source our data source is prometheus, 
 configure promitiusthere we have to add url and ip address, we can import the required dashboard here 
 we will import node exporter dashboard after saving the dashboard will appear with cpu,memory usage and load average and other things
