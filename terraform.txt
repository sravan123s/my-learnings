Procedural vs Declarative
Procedural approach means if you want to get something you need to mention the 
things in an programmatic approach which means in order. "Ansible" works on the procedural.
But in Declarative approach you no need to worry about flow it will automatically gets the 
respective information based up the resource what we are choosing (or) if the things in the code not in order also it will work

as controller by installing the s/w

DEFINE MODULES IN TERRAFORM?
Modules in terraform containing several resources which are combined to form a root module in terraform all the resources are 
in .tf file

WHAT IS TERRAGRUNT?
Terragrunt is a covering laver which is used to cover terraform and it is very thin in nature, 
terragrunt will exicute terraform in multiple modules at once 
terragrunt  helps to write codes in terraforem but as i mentioned it is one time process
this eliminates the need to write code for every structure of envernment and deletes the duplicate code

TERRAFORM
. Terraform init .
. Terraform plan
. Terraform apply
. Terraform destroy
. Terraform show==> to show all the details

Ingres block: it talks about the in bound rules
egress block: it talks about the out bound rules

ex:
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "dvs7key" {
  key_name   = "dvstechnologies"
  public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD3F6tyPEFEzV0LX3X8BsXdMsQz1x2cEikKDEY0aIj41qgxMCP/iteneqXSIFZBp5vizPvaoIR3Um9xK7PGoW8giupGn+EPuxIA4cDM4vzOqOkiMPhz5XK0whEjkVzTo4+S0puvDZuwIsdiW9mxhJc7tgBNL0cYlWSYVkz4G/fslNfRPW5mYAM49f4fhtxPb5ok4Q2Lg9dPKVHO/Bgeu5woMc7RY0p1ej6D4CKFE6lymSDJpW0YHX/wqE9+cfEauh7xZcG0q9t2ta6F6fmX0agvpFyZo8aFbXeUBr7osSCJNgvavWbM/06niWrOvYX2xwWdhXmXSrbX8ZbabVohBK41 email@example.com"
